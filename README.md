# Image Classification

In this notebook, I have analyzed cats and dogs images using a Convolution Neural Network(CNN) model. I have used 2000 images for training and 1000 images for tests. An ImageDataGenerator is used to generate images. Without it, the model was overfitting the training data.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install foobar.

```bash
pip install -r requiremets.txt
```

We get more than 70% accuracy in predicting train and validation images.
